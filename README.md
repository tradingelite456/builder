# [doGior](https://github.com/doGior)'s Had Enough

Hi, I'm doGior, and I've had enough of searching for Cloudstream plugins that end up broken or
abandoned, so I decided to create my own repository. These are the plugins available at the moment:

### Current plugins

<strong>*</strong> If you want to be able to see TV channels from your country
go [here](https://github.com/Free-TV/IPTV/blob/master/playlists/) select the file that corresponds
to your desired country, click raw and copy the url of the page. In the app, once you have Canali TV installed,
go on settings -> general -> clone site -> Canali TV -> apply and here you can type the name for
your extension and paste the url you copied earlier. Once you click clone site you should have the
new extension with your desired channels in the homescreen selector.
